## üß© Project Overview
This project is a **C# console-based Dictionary Management System** developed collaboratively by **Group 3** for **Module 7** in COP2360 (C# Programming).  
The program allows users to **add, search, update, delete, and display dictionary entries** in a clean, menu-driven format.  

It demonstrates teamwork, version control via GitHub, and the use of object-oriented design principles such as:
- Classes and methods organization  
- Proper data handling using `Dictionary<string, List<string>>`  
- Input validation and user feedback  
- Structured menus and modular logic
